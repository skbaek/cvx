Do we need derivative information?

What backend solvers are the most important ones for us?

Do we also need to transform the dual problem?

Thesis 4.2 introduces transformations!

Thesis 4.2.4 seems to suggest that also cvx can give us dual information about the original
problem. So do we really need to reimplement cvx to be able to verify its results?

The solvers list of CVX suggests that backends solve only LP QP SOCP SDP GP and Integer.
But the thesis suggests that other problems can also be solved if code for 
barriers, derivatives, or cutting planes is provided. In those cases, the dual information might not
be as useful, though.

Operate ereal or real?
